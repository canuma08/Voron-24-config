[octoprint_compat]
enable_ufp: True
#   When set to True the octoprint_compat module will report that the UFP
#   plugin is available.  If the installed version of Cura supports UFP

#   slicers.  The default is True.

[history]

[update_manager]
enable_auto_refresh: False
#   When set to True Moonraker will attempt to fetch status about
#   available updates roughly every 24 hours, between 12am-4am.
#   When set to False Moonraker will only fetch update state on startup
#   and clients will need to request that Moonraker updates state.  The
#   default is False.
refresh_interval: 672
#   The interval (in hours) after which the update manager will check
#   for new updates.  This interval is applies to updates for Moonraker,
#   Klipper, and System Packages, and is the default for all clients.
#   The default is 672 hours (28 days).
enable_system_updates: True
#   A boolean value that can be used to toggle system package updates.
#   Currently Moonraker only supports updating packages via APT, so
#   this option is useful for users that wish to experiment with linux
#   distros that use other package management applications, or users
#   that prefer to manage their packages directly.  Note that if this
#   is set to False users will be need to make sure that all system
#   dependencies are up to date.  The default is True.
enable_packagekit: True
#   This option is available when system updates are enabled via the
#   "enable_system_updates" option.  When set to True, system package
#   updates will be processed via PackageKit over D-Bus.  When set to False
#   the "apt cli" fallback will be used.  The default is True.
channel: dev
#   The update channel applied to Klipper and Moonraker.  May dev or
#   beta.  The dev channel will update to the latest commit pushed
#   to the repo, whereas the beta channel will update to the latest
#   commit tagged by Moonraker.  The beta channel will see less frequent
#   updates and should be more stable.  Users on the beta channel will have
#   more opportunity to review breaking changes before choosing to update.
#   The default is dev.

[machine]
provider: systemd_dbus
#   The provider implementation used to collect system service information
#   and run service actions (ie: start, restart, stop).  This can be "none",
#   "supervisord", "systemd_dbus", or "systemd_cli".  If the provider is set
#   to "none" service action APIs will be disabled.
#   The default is systemd_dbus.
sudo_password: Worldperk@67
#   The password for the linux user.  When set Moonraker can run linux commands
#   that require elevated permissions.  This option accepts Jinja2 Templates,
#   see the [secrets] section for details.  It is strongly recommended to only
#   set this option when required and to use the aforementioned secrets module
#   when doing so.  The default is no sudo password is set.
validate_service: TRUE
#   Enables validation of Moonraker's systemd service unit.  If Moonraker
#   detects that a change is necessary it will attempt to do so.  Custom
#   installations and installations that do systemd should set this to False.
#   The default is True.
validate_config: TRUE
#   Enables validation of Moonraker's configuration.  If Moonraker detects
#   deprecated options it will attempt to correct them.  The default is True.
force_validation: FALSE
#   By default Moonraker will not attempt to revalidate if a previous attempt
#   at validation successfully completed. Setting this value to True will force
#   Moonraker to perform validation.  The default is False.
#supervisord_config_path:
#   Path to the supervisord config file. This is required when for multiple
#   supervisord are instances running on single machine and the default
#  '/var/run/supervisord.sock' is occupied by other services.
#   The default is no path.

[data_store]
temperature_store_size: 1200
#   The maximum number of temperature values to store for each sensor. Note
#   that this value also applies to the "target", "power", and "fan_speed"
#   if the sensor reports them.  The default is 1200, which is enough to
#   store approximately 20 minutes of data at one value per second.
gcode_store_size:  1000
#   The maximum number "gcode lines" to store.  The default is 1000.

[announcements]
subscriptions:
#   A newline separated list announcement "subscriptions".  Generally
#   this would refer to specific clients that are registered to provide
#   announcements.  All items specified here are added in addition to
#   "moonraker" and "klipper", which are always subscribed to.  The default
#   is no additional subscriptions.
dev_mode: False
#   A developer option that fetches RSS announcements from a local folder when
#   set to True. The default behavior is for Moonraker to retrieve announcements
#   from RSS feeds generated by the "moonlight" repo on GitHub.
