[z_thermal_adjust]
temp_coeff: 0.0111
#   The temperature coefficient of expansion, in mm/K. For example, a
#   temp_coeff of 0.01 mm/K will move the Z axis downwards by 0.01 mm for every
#   Kelvin/degree celcius that the frame temperature increases. Defaults to 0.0,
#   no offset.

gcode_id: chamber_z
#   Temperature sensor to use for frame temp measurement. Use full config
#   section name without quoutes. E.g. temperature_sensor frame
#smooth_time:
#   Smoothing window applied to the temp_sensor, in seconds. Can reduce motor
#   noise from excessive small corrections in response to sensor noise. The
#   default is 2.0 seconds.
#z_adjust_off_above:
#   Disables compensation above this Z height [mm]. The last computed correction
#   will remain applied until the toolhead moves below the specified Z position
#   again. The default is 0.0mm (always on).
#max_z_adjustment:
#   Maximum absolute compensation that can be applied to the Z axis [mm]. The
#   default is 99999999.0mm (unlimited).
z_stepper: stepper_z
#   The Z stepper motor linked with the Z endstop, as written in printer.cfg.
#   Used for triggering reference temperature measurement. Usually 'stepper_z'
#   unless otherwise defined.
